Chris,\r\n\r\nAs discussed in https://github.com/defunkt/dotjs/pull/44 you're open to serving CSS & images but prefer a different location. \r\n\r\nIn this patch, CSS is served from ~/.js/css and images from ~/.jss/images. I've also updated the Chrome extension to auto-load CSS upon page load. No longer does one need to JS to insert style tags.\r\n\r\nI hope you'll accept this patch and merge it in. It would also close https://github.com/defunkt/dotjs/pull/44.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\n@bartt"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/defunkt/dotjs/issues/comments/52176861","html_url":"https://github.com/defunkt/dotjs/pull/56#issuecomment-52176861","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/defunkt/dotjs/issues/56","id":52176861,"user":{"login":"Sh00ck","id":1037067,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1037067?v=2","gravatar_id":"681ab3e606b4694009d7672eb9fb76f8","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sh00ck","html_url":"https://github.com/Sh00ck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sh00ck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sh00ck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sh00ck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sh00ck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sh00ck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sh00ck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sh00ck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sh00ck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sh00ck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-14T12:29:43Z","updated_at":"2014-08-14T12:29:43Z","body":"If this get merged, please replace the .js directory with .dotjs and put there 3 folders called 'js', 'css' and 'images'.
