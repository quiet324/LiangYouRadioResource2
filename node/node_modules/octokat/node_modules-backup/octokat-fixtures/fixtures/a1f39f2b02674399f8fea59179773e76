implements https://github.com/stellar/stellar-client/issues/850\r\n\r\nInitially, tradeOperation was all lowercase and the button would become `[buy STR]`. I needed a way to make it uppercase. There were several ways:\r\n\r\n1. Using css uppercase (used here: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-client/blob/trading/app/templates/trading-form.html#L44 ) (may interfere with i18n/l10n due to edge cases in some languages (see below))\r\n2. Creating an AngularJS filter for update (Might adversely affect i18n/l10n due to edge cases)\r\n3. Detecting if tradeOperation was 'buy' or 'sell' and then outputting the correct string (best for i18n/l10n but clunky)\r\n4. Changing tradeOperation to be represented in the correct casing and directly using it  (simple and good for i18n/l10n)\r\n\r\nThere are edge cases in capitalizing and not all the browsers do css capitalization the same. Read more about the edge cases here (also take a look at browser [in]compatibility): https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-transform\r\n\r\nI'm hoping to avoid problems with capitalization in the future (as Drupal had): https://www.drupal.org/node/1496418\r\n\r\nBecause of this, I think that it would be best to let translators decide on the capitalization and not interfere (with css or a filter).","created_at":"2014-09-24T18:32:25Z","updated_at":"2014-09-26T21:21:16Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b4a51d7c51ab9cf24b9744af5b95345f3984f0ec","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stellar/stellar-client/pulls/856/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stellar/stellar-client/pulls/856/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stellar/stellar-client/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stellar/stellar-client/issues/856/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stellar/stellar-client/statuses/556e5552ba7d569f4a135b2bac3c74e0c1d74bf1","head":{"label":"stellar:change-submit-label-850","ref":"change-submit-label-850","sha":"556e5552ba7d569f4a135b2bac3c74e0c1d74bf1","user":{"login":"stellar","id":7386716,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7386716?v=2","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stellar","html_url":"https://github.com/stellar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stellar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stellar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stellar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stellar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stellar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stellar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stellar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stellar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stellar/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19084480,"name":"stellar-client","full_name":"stellar/stellar-client","owner":{"login":"stellar","id":7386716,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7386716?v=2","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stellar","html_url":"https://github.com/stellar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stellar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stellar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stellar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stellar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stellar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stellar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stellar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stellar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stellar/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/stellar/stellar-client","description":"Browser
