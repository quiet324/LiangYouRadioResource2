It’s also about 20% faster (see benchmarks below). `Symbol#to_proc` is already used in many places throughout the Rails codebase, but not everywhere. This patch makes the codebase more consistent and concise. In some cases, it reduces the number of lines of code. For example, in `railties/lib/rails/application/routes_reloader.rb`:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndef finalize!\r\n  route_sets.each do |routes|\r\n    routes.finalize!\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecomes:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndef finalize!\r\n  route_sets.each(&:finalize!)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe net result is 30 fewer lines of code.\r\n\r\nFor those who don’t know the history, `Symbol#to_proc` was originally part of Active Support, before being merged into the Ruby language in version 1.9 (and back-ported to 1.8.7). The Active Support implementation was slightly slower than using a block but the C implementation in MRI is considerably faster.\r\n\r\n##### Benchmark\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire 'benchmark/ips'\r\n\r\ndef block\r\n  (1..100).map{|i| i.to_s}\r\nend\r\n\r\ndef to_proc\r\n  (1..100).map(&:to_s)\r\nend\r\n\r\nBenchmark.ips do |x|\r\n  x.report('block')   { block   }\r\n  x.report('to_proc') { to_proc }\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n###### Ruby 2.1.2p95\r\n\r\n```\r\n  block 46707.3 (±7.8%) i/s - 235768 in 5.079617s\r\nto_proc 55143.5 (±7.2%) i/s - 276554 in 5.040752s\r\n```\r\n\r\n###### Ruby 2.0.0p481\r\n\r\n```\r\n  block 33271.0 (±6.8%) i/s - 168646 in 5.093196s\r\nto_proc 37346.0 (±7.6%) i/s - 188870 in 5.087220s\r\n```\r\n\r\n###### Ruby 1.9.3p545\r\n\r\n```\r\n  block 31478.7 (±11.3%) i/s - 156876 in 5.056661s\r\nto_proc 39219.9  (±7.2%) i/s - 195210 in 5.004236s\r\n```"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/56984831","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/16833#issuecomment-56984831","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/16833","id":56984831,"user":{"login":"sferik","id":10308,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10308?v=2","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik","html_url":"https://github.com/sferik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sferik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-26T16:25:06Z","updated_at":"2014-09-26T16:25:06Z","body":"@bquorning Thanks for running your own benchmarks and pointing this out.\r\n\r\nI’d argue that for small enumerables, performance is less critical. I was optimizing to make the worst-case scenario 20% faster, even if that comes at the cost of making the best-case scenario 10% slower. I stand by that trade-off but it might be worth looking at the individual cases and applying this change more selectively, rather than across the board.\r\n\r\nIn the example I used above (iterating over `route_sets`), I think it’s reasonable to assume that number will be greater than 5 for any production Rails application. However, there are other examples (e.g. iterating over email attachments), where the number is likely to be less than 5, most of the time.\r\n\r\nI decided to optimize for the worst-case scenario and apply the change consistently throughout the codebase but I’m happy to consider each case individually and make a judgment about whether the enumerable is likely to be greater or less than 5.
